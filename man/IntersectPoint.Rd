\title{
Find where point opposite segment intersects segment.
}
\description{
Find where point opposite segment intersects segment.    It gives a proportion of AB that the
orthogonal line passing through C meets. If outside (0,1) it does not pass through AB
}
\usage{
IntersectPoint(A, B, C)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{A}{
\code{(x,y)} point on one end of line segment
}
  \item{B}{
\code{(x,y)} point on other end of line segment
}
  \item{C}{
\code{(x,y)} point to compare to line segment
}
}
\value{
returns a value which is the proportion of the length of \code{AB} where \code{AC} proects onto the line defined by AB. If the return value is between 0 and 1, the point is opposite the line segment.  If negative, it falls on the \code{A} side of \code{AB}; if greater than 1, it falls to the \code{B} side of \code{AB}.
